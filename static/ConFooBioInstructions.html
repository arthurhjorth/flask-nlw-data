<h1>Welcome to Crops vs Creatures! </h1>
<p>You are a farmer with 9 squares of land. You make your living by selling crops.  </p>
<p>However, there is also a population of crop-raiding creatures who live on the land you farm. When creatures land on farmed squares, they eat crops and reduce your yield. How much damage they cause depends on the number of creatures in that square.  </p>
<p>Each game lasts 8 rounds, which are equal to an agricultural year.</p>
<p>The government is concerned about creature populations so have introduced a system of fines and/or subsidies to help protect them.</p>
<p>In each land square you can choose one of four options: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Farm crops </li>
    <li>Farm crops and scare creatures </li>
    <li>Farm crops and shoot creatures </li>
    <li>Don’t farm – leave land for creatures </li>
</ol>
<p>Each square you farm has a yield of +4. Scaring decreases this yield by 1, due to the time cost, but also means creatures have an 60% chance of leaving the square. </p>
<p>Shooting has a 50% change of killing creatures, removing them from the landscape permanently. However, there’s an 80% chance you may get caught and fined. </p>
<p>You can also choose not to farm a square, and instead leave it alone for creatures to live in. You will get no crop yields from these squares, but creatures will be attracted to them and you may get subsidy payments from the government.</p>
